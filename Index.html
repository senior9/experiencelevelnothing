                                After college, I designed textile necklaces as a side gig to my creativity-sapping day job. Jewelry making was good busy work for idle hands. But when my handcrafted masterpieces started to garner repeated compliments from friends, I wondered, “Could my hobby become a legitimate jewelry business?”

                            One of the best ways to foster creativity in little kids is to sit down and do a crafting kit with them. Craft kits set a particular goal, show you how it’s done and teach you the skills required, and provide you with everything you need to make something new. They’re also exciting to browse because there are just so many different kinds out there, especially for little girls.Sometimes have so many choices, however, is an intimidating thing. Many people would prefer a slightly more narrow search so they can evaluate their options a little more effectively and really choose the kit that’s best for them. That’s part of the reason we’ve been browsing the best crafting kits for little girls that we could find online, comparing and contrasting their perks and drawbacks.
